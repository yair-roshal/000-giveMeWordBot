# Coding workflow preferences


- Focus only on the code areas that are directly relevant to the task.
- Do not modify unrelated parts of the codebase.
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- Do not change the patterns or architecture of a working feature unless explicitly instructed.
- Always consider how your changes might affect other parts of the codebase.
