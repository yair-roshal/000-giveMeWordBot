# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple and readable solutions.
- Always check for existing code before writing new logic to avoid duplication.
- Always make sure your code works properly in dev, test, and prod environments.
- Only make changes that are explicitly requested, or that are clearly related and well understood.
- When fixing a bug or issue, avoid introducing new patterns or technologies unless necessary. If you do, make sure to fully remove the old implementation afterward to avoid duplicated logic.
- Keep the codebase well-structured, clean, and easy to navigate.
- Avoid writing standalone scripts unless they are truly reusable. Never leave temporary or one-off scripts in the repo.
- Keep files under 300 lines. Refactor when a file grows too large.
- Only use mocked data inside test files. Do not mock data in development or production code.
- Never add fake data or stub logic in code that runs in dev or prod.
- Never overwrite the existing `.env` file without explicit confirmation from the developer.
